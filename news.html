      <p> Our lab recently published a paper titled

          "Experiment-free exoskeleton assistance via learning in simulation"</a> in the journal Nature.
         This collaborative effort demonstrated a new method that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and computer
        simulations to train robotic exoskeletons to autonomously help users save energy while walking,
        running, and climbing stairs. This breakthrough may provide a generalizable and scalable strategy for rapid
        development and widespread adoption of a variety of assistive robots for both able-bodied and mobility-impaired
        individuals.
