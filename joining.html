  <!--
<p><strong>Position #1</strong>: Mechanical design of soft robots, including wearable robots for patients with impairments and steerable surgical robots. Experience in actuator design, cable transmission, series elastic actuators, electric motors, or pneumatics is a plus.  </p><br>
<p align="justify"><strong>Position #2</strong>: Developing force and position control algorithms for our soft exoskeleton robot and soft  bi-manual humanoid robot. Experience in impedance control and haptics is a plus. This is a great opportunity to lead a new research direction on a new generation of wearable robot and humanoid robot platforms with several PIs who have expertise in mechatronics, computer vision, and machine learning.  </p><br>
<p align="justify">A Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field is required. Candidates will be expected to carry out a creative and independent research agenda, publish scholarly papers, and take on a mentorship role for undergraduate and graduate students at NCSU. </p>
